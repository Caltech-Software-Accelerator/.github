## Hi there 👋

# 👋 Welcome to the Caltech Software Accelerator

We’re a growing community of scholars, researchers, and engineers at **Caltech** working together to accelerate scientific discovery through better software.

Following the inaugural roundtable discussion led by **Mike Gurnis** (Schmidt Academy for Software Engineering) and **Kaushik Bhattacharya** (Vice Provost for Research), we’ve continued to build momentum around creating a vibrant **research software engineering community** at Caltech.

## 🌱 What We're Building

There is strong and growing interest in fostering a space where we can:

- Connect across disciplines
- Share ideas, tools, and best practices
- Explore topics in scientific computing, research software, and reproducibility
- Learn about emerging opportunities in software engineering for science

We’ve hosted a series of **engaging monthly lunch meetings**, featuring talks and discussions led by Caltech community members and invited speakers from both on and off campus.
