# 🌟 Caltech Software Accelerator – Shared GitHub Resources

Welcome to the Caltech Software Accelerator’s central hub for community standards and shared tools! This repository helps bring consistency, clarity, and collaboration to everything we build together.

## 🧭 What Is This?

This is the `.github` repository for our organization. GitHub automatically uses the files here to apply default behaviors across **all of our repositories** — so contributors and maintainers can focus on building, not boilerplate.

Here you’ll find:
- 🧵 Issue and pull request templates for smoother collaboration  
- 🤖 GitHub Actions to automate repetitive tasks  
- 📜 Guidelines for contributing and maintaining a healthy project culture  
- 🙌 Shared values like our Code of Conduct

## 🤝 For Contributors

We want every project in this organization to feel welcoming and inclusive. Whether you're filing a bug report, suggesting a feature, or opening a pull request, our templates aim to help you communicate clearly and effectively.

- Start with the **Issue Templates** in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
- Follow our **Contributing Guidelines** to understand how we work together
- Review the **Code of Conduct** to help us maintain a respectful, collaborative space

We welcome your ideas and improvements — this is your community too.

## 🛠 For Maintainers
